LD24-Submission
===============
I didn't get as far as I wanted to get this time but I learned an important
lesson. You can build a game in a weekend, however engine and game in a
weekend is questionable. I intend to finish the game because I like the idea
but I ended up spending too much time relearning trig than writting the game.
