LD24-Submission
===============
I didn't get as far as I wanted to get this time but I learned an important\n
lesson. You can build a game in a weekend, however engine and game in a\n
weekend is questionable. I intend to finish the game because I like the idea\n
but I ended up spending too much time relearning trig than writting the game.\n
